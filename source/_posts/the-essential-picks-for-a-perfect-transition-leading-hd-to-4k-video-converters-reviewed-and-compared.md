4K gradually becomes an integrated part of our daily life. In the TV shopping mall, you can see the 4K videos on 4K TVs; it's pretty common to stream 4K movies, TV shows from Amazon, Netflix, and Apple TV; or you can still purchase the 4K discs made by Sony Pictures for watching on [4K video players](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) or 4K TVs. Let's face it, the real 4K video sources are still few and between, which means most of us will be watching content in good, old-fashioned regular high-definition: 1920x1080 (1080i or 1080p) or 1280x720 (720p), both of which have far fewer pixels than 4K. However, there is no biggie that you don't have 4K videos since you can upscale HD to 4K for clearer and sharper image, with a [HD to 4K video converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).

## Why Should You Upscale 720P 1080P HD to 4K?

The reasons why you should convert HD to 4K may be various. But ultimately, you must want to enjoy a clearer and crisper 4K resolution video. Here I pick up some users' appeals about why they want to upconvert 720p/1080p HD to 4K resolution.

_So I am in the market for a 4k TV (possibly). Currently I have a Sony Bravia from probably 6-7 years ago. It is 1080 - 40 inch. Now my concern is that most content today is 1080 and so I would want to get a 4k TV with the best up-scaling processor out there._ \- Megan

_I have purchased a Samsung UN65KS8000 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV for watching movies and TV shows with better experience. For [Netflix 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) streaming, Amazon and Apple TV 4K sources, it does indeed. But when it comes to my HD video collections, the video quality goes not as well as I think. So, I'm wondering upconvert HD to 4K files._ \- Andrew

_My issue with Roku 4 HD upscaling. My TV is a high-end 85" Sony BRAVIA X950B that is set to 3840x2160\. And my Roku 4 box is set to 4K as well. With the Roku 4 that instead of passing the 1080p content to the TV, it attempts to upscale it to 4K, but the results are often terrible. So is there any HD to 4K upscaler help me watch 1080p HD on my 4K TV with Roku flawlessly?_ \- Steve

### What's HD? 720p, 1080i, 1080p 1440p HD - What's the difference?

[HD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition%5Fvideo) is video of higher resolution and quality than standard-definition. While there is no standardized meaning for high-definition, generally any video image with considerably more than 480 vertical lines (North America) or 576 vertical lines (Europe) is considered high-definition. So there are several types of HD videos:

* 720p (1280×720 px), also called HD Ready or standard HD, is a progressive HDTV signal format with 720 horizontal lines and an aspect ratio of 16:9\.
* 1080i (1920×1080 px), known as Full HD, which is featured with interlacing scanning.
* 1080p (1920×1080 px), known as Full HD as well. But unlike 1080i, it's scanned in progressive type.
* 1440p, also Quad HD, is a display resolution of 2560×1440 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio. It has four times as many pixels as HD (720p).
