Q1: _Downloaded some MKV 2160p movie files in H.264 codec, but the file size is larger that eats up my storage soon. It there an easy way to convert my MKV files to HEVC to save more space, because HEVC offers better compression ratio._ 

Q2: _The video file is in .mkv format. My iPhone 7 doesn't support playing MKV videos. I've upgraded to the latest iOS 11 and it now supports MP4 HEVC. So I need to change MKV format to HEVC, preferably. A fast [HEVC converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) is appreciated._

##  What Is MKV? 

[MKV](https://matroska.org) is an open-source container format designed to hold any type of codec. Specifically, it can contain an unlimited number of streams including video (DivX, Xvid, RV9), audio (MP3, Ogg, AC3, AAC, etc) and subtitles (SRT, ASS, SSA, etc) in the same file. These streams are likely compressed and have been produced with an encoder. So not all media players, mobile devices, computers, TVs, and more can play MKV, even with the [MKV codec pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) installed. The bad compatibility with mobile devices drives a rising demand for MKV conversion to a more compatible format, like HEVC. 

## What on Earth is HEVC/H.265?

[HEVC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), aka H.265, is a video compression standard, a successor to H.264 AVC. Videos encoded in HEVC or H.265 is achieved at the lowest possible bit rate, 50% less than other formats. Specifically, [HEVC encoding](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) halves the video file size at the same level of video quality or tremendously enhances the image quality at the same bit rate compared with the widely used H.264\. This makes HEVC/H.265 the most popular codec in 4K video compression, up to 8K UHD. You don't need huge hard drives to store your UHD files. See how to convert H.264 to H.265\. 

HEVC/H.265, on the other hand, has less compatibility with mobile devices so far, as compared with H.264\. But with iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra add HEVC codec in the support list, we can foresee more and more mobiles will jump on the bandwagon. So when it comes to a large HD MKV movie, especially the MKV file in 4K UHD resolution, the conversion from MKV to HEVC is highly demanded. 

## Recommended Program to Convert MKV to HEVC/H.265 at Fast Speed 

The swift from MKV files to HEVC or H.265 will be achieved as long as you have a video converter in hand. But the truth is most programs don't include HEVC/H.265 into its codec buildup plan. At the very least, some free video converters just offers to tweak the HEVC codec setting manually, which is really complicated for beginners, while others like Handbrake, though claiming to convert MKV to H.265 (x265) directly, but the lengthy process can be a thorny obstacle.
