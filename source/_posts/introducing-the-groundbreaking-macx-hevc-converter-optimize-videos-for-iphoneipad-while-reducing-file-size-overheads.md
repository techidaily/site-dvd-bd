_MacXDVD announces with proud that MacX Video Converter Pro continues to hold sway in HEVC encoding, decoding and conversion via a kernel update. Immediately following the epoch-making achievement in being the 1st to support HEVC codec, MacX Video Converter Pro extends its readymade profiles for HEVC, triumphantly having 4K/HD video converted to HEVC MP4, for a seamless playback on newer Macs, and lower-capacity iPhones and iPads without chewing up all available storage._

MacXDVD Software proudly announces that its ace MacX Video Converter Pro has risen to throne as the world's most stable, powerful and fastest [HEVC converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Two kernel updates completed lately are some of the factors that make it take the reins in HEVC encoding and decoding: one is being the forerunner to add HEVC into the supported video codec list, and the other is ensuring a stable and fast HD/4K video conversion to HEVC MP4, tailored to end the video incompatibility issue with newer Macs, and space-constrained iphones and ipads, without eating up all available space.

MacX Video Converter Pro makes breakout success in HEVC video converting. For more information, please visit: <https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-video-converter-pro/>

The transition from high definition video to space-hogging 4K video gives rise to a speedy adoption of HEVC, in such a way to end the gridlocks of heavy bandwidth consumption and large space occupation. Known as a more efficient video compression standard that delivers identical quality with half the file size of H.264 or results in significantly higher quality at any fixed bandwidth, HEVC (aka H.265) is ready to rock and roll. Apple jumps on the HEVC bandwagon in the latest iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra, a while back hardware HEVC encoders and decoders are built in to new phones, cameras, PCs, TVs, and more. Netflix is also upping its game to HEVC for easier 4k video streaming. The exception to this rule is software HEVC encoder and decoder is still immature, though urgently demanded. But MacX Video Converter Pro gets hands on both HEVC decoding and encoding as follows: 

**Decode HEVC/H.265 videos for better compatibility**   
With as many as 370+ video/audio codecs, the latest version works as a [HEVC decoder](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) that will aid you to decode and convert any videos including HEVC/[H.265 to H.264](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), MP4, MKV, AVI, WMV, MPEG4, FLV, MTS, and other mainstream formats, required for smoothly playing the HEVC encoded contents on smartphones, tablets, apps, TVs, gaming systems, etc.

**Encode videos into HEVC/H.265 for smaller size and easier sharing**   
MacX Video Converter Pro is a feature-packed HEVC video converter that can compress and convert 4K/multi-track HD videos to HEVC/H.265 to save storage space and bandwidth consumption. The [HEVC encoder](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)is preprogrammed with 410+ readymade profiles, covering everything from the breathtaking HEVC (.mp4 and .mkv) to the latest iPhone X, iPhone 8 (Plus), iPad Pro, Apple TV 4K, Samsung Galaxy S8, and more, so that you won't tinker with the parameter settings but directly use them for intended purposes, such as play HEVC on iPhones iPads running on iOS 11 or Macs working with High Sierra. In addition to HEVC video converter, it can also download online videos, edit videos, record screen, and make photo slideshows.

Apart from HEVC video converting, the program leaps forward with 2k/4k upconverting and downconverting and accomplishes a dramatic speed boost with the aid of hardware acceleration tech, according to MacXDVD. Now users will convert a 4k file (4.30 min) on a Intel QSV enabled computer in 1 minute only, which is up to 5x faster than competitors. 

**Price and Availability**

The original price of MacX Video Converter Pro (lifetime version) is $59.95\. But now you are privileged to get the fully licensed HEVC video converter at 50% off, available now at <https://www.macxdvd.com/special-offer/>.
