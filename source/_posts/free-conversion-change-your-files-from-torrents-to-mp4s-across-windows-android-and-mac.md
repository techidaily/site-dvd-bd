## Part 4\. How to Compress Torrent to Smaller Size? 

_I'm a pro user and the inability to compress torrents larger than 4 gb is making me reconsider my membership. There are some torrents that have more than 3000+ little files, if these torrents can't be compressed, how can I download so many files individually? This issue needs to be rectified._ 

Many torrent movie files are very large in size, especially those MKV torrents. Even though you convert torrent MKV file to MP4 with comparatively smaller file size, the truth is that the converted MP4 torrent file is still too large for your mobile device like iPhone iPad, if you don't want to only store one or two torrent files therein. In such case, you still need to compress your MP4 torrent file size. How to compress torrent? Here two solutions you can try:

### Solution 1 - Change MP4 Torrent File Parameter Video Resolution, Frame Rate and Bit Rate

Properly adjust resolution (640\*480 recommended), and lower the bit rate 20-50% compared with its default one. Normally, the smaller video you want, the lower bit rate you should keep.

## Part 5\. FAQs about Torrent Conversion

**1\. What is the difference between Torrent and BitTorrent?**

BitTorrent is an internet peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that works in a sort of decentralized fashion. When you say BitTorrent file, it generally means links referencing special BitTorrent protocols, which is almost impossible to convert BitTorrent files directly to MP4 Videos. While a torrent file is a computer file that contains metadata of files and folders to be distributed, and it can be converted into MP4 format.

**2\. How to change a torrent file to a MP4 video?**

There is some confusion between .torrent files and downloaded torrents. Let's be clear. A .torrent file is not the exact movie or video you want to download and you can't go to convert it. It's rather a file that helps you to download the right stuff. So before you go to real torrent movie to MP4 conversion, you need to install a torrent client like uTorrent and open the .torrent file to download the torrents. Then you will get a .mkv or .avi file. That's what you need to convert MKV/AVI torrent movie to MP4 for easier playback.

**3\. How to open a torrent file?**

Torrents allow you to download any type of file. Different files will require different programs. The extension or file type can help you determine what program to use for opening torrent files. As for unknown files, perform a quick web search for the file extension to see what programs you can use. 

* WinZip is here for you to open a torrent file with a zip extension.
* Double-click on the "setup.exe" file to install the Windows application if what you get is ended with exe file extension.
* It's a no brainer if your torrent file is a video type. Install VLC player, 5Kplayer, KMPlayer, etc. to open it.
* Double-click the file on your Windows or macOS if the downloaded torrent file goes to ISO image, as both your Windows 10 and macOS are able to recognize ISO image files without using extra plugin.

**4\. How do I play a torrent video?**

There are some torrent streaming apps that you can use to play torrent files without downloading or converting. Our favorites are WebTorrent Desktop, Webtor, and Rox Player. To play a torrent video, for example, with WebTorrent Desktop, use the following steps. Drag the torrent file magnet link onto the player, or go to File > Open Torrent Address and paste the torrent magnet link instead. Then click on OK to load the torrent files, click the Play button to play the torrent videos without downloading.

**5\. Can torrent site give you viruses?**

Yes. The official torrent sites (e.g., uTorrent, BitTorrent), are free of malware and can be used safely and privately jointly with a VPN. They don't, however, prevent some malware programmers from writing some virus files with malicious scripts and hiding them within the normal safe files with an intention to attack your system. 

Before you convert Torrent to MP4, you'd better make sure whether your torrent contains a virus. So checking your torrent with a virus detector is necessary.

Warm prompt: after you know a thing or two about torrent files, there is still one thing needed to be noted. Downloading a torrent file, especially a new movie torrent you download from a torrent download site, usually refers to copyright infringement. So it's advised to get its DVD version from Amazon or other DVD stores and make a back of your own DVD as DVD ripping for personal use in some countries like U.K. is sheer legal.
