Usually, a video size converter is high-sounding so consumers believe that this application has powerful features that it clearly doesn't and most of the time isn't anything like they lead you to believe. Take Handbrake for instance. When you google " **video size reducer**" or "convert video to smaller size without losing quality", Google will show you the top results, among which two YouTube videos titled "How To Reduce a Video File Size By Over 90%! Without Losing Quality" will definitely draw you attention. You can't help wondering if this free video size converter can really shrink file size up to 90%. 

I have the same feeling with you. Hence, I watch the 2013 uploaded YouTube video and get the operating steps. I use the method it tells to have a test in Handbrake 1.0.1 on my iMac (Yosemite). The result shows that I can only compress MKV (AVC) video to MP4 (H264) from 89.4 MB to 78.7MB with little quality loss. That's a big gap between propagation slogan and real test result. If Handbrake can really reduce video size up to 90%, my output file should be 8.94MB. So until now, do you still believe the advertisement? 

In case you plan to change a video compressor, here recommends you a genuine application, which is 100% exactly what it claims or better.

Building on the above data, we can see if you wanna use video size converter to [reduce video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for mobile device (Android/iOS), you're suggested to consider MP4(H264), MP4 (HEVC), MOV (H264) and MKV, for they do a great job in file size reduction and output quality, as well as video compatibility. Supposing file size is the key, 3GP and WMV (wmv2) are your primary choices. As for video uploading or E-mail/Gmail, you can't miss MP4 (H264) or WMV. After all, the video quality you should still pay much attention to. So far, if you still think the output file size is too large, you can further [edit video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) with this video size reducer. And seemingly, it works quite well.

So, you're suggested to choose MP4 (H265) or MP4 (H264) from "Mac General Video". If you need to even smaller-sized format, go to "PC General Video" to choose WMV or 3GP.
