Sometimes, this free Mac DVD ripper stutters and gives audio video not syncing problem. To rip a DVD with protection on Mac, you need to install the third-party libdvdcss to help Handbrake ignore the CSS protections. 

It is a bit complicated for beginners to learn how to use the free DVD ripper, detailed guide is shared below.

###  How to use Handbrake to rip DVD on mac for free

### Common Problems with Handbrake 

_**Q:** Unable to rip newly purchased DVD on Ventura with Handbrake. I've been having issues ripping some new DVD releases that I bought as the end result would make scratching high frequency sounds like the disk is severely scratched even though it's not. I want to transfer the DVD to tablet so I can watch it on the go._ 

**A:** Handbrake is a good open source DVD ripper for macOS Ventura or earlier, but it has its limits. Handbrake fails to copy newly released DVDs that comes with protection schemes. As I mentioned above, Handbrake will give error message like [no valid source found](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), DVD not loading at the beginning, [Handbrake showing 99 titles](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). And sometimes, it seems that Handbrake can copy the DVD to macOS Ventura/Big Sur but it turns out to be a small unplayable clip with only a few KB. There's little you can do except to another DVD ripper to rip protected DVDs. 

_**Q:** I always used Handbrake but it seems to not work so well anymore. It keeps making choppy video on output which it never used to do._ 

**A:** There're two main reasons why Handbrake outputs choppy video/scrambled or broken up video when copying DVD to Mac, the first is that the DVD is encrypted, the other is that the Handbrake settings are not appropriate. If you are not sure how to do the settings, just keep it as original in Handbrake. 

## 3\. Cisdem Video Converter - Light & Fast Mac DVD Ripper

Don't be fooled by its name. Though its official name is video converter, it still sports with DVD ripping feature to rip DVDs to MP4 MOV MKV digital format on mac, as well as 1:1 copy DVD with original quality. Meanwhile, this top DVD ripper for macOS Sierra enhances its DVD ripping competitiveness with 30X faster speed, boosted by advanced accelerating technology and world-leading disc decryption technique.

DVDs top out at 480p; meaning the picture quality pales in comparison to a 1080p Blu-ray disc. Cisdem knows that and thoughtfully prepares the DVD upscaling feature for you to convert and upscale DVD quality to 1080p HD or even 4K Ultra HD. Certainly, this would come at the price of larger output size. Give it a shot if large file size is okay to you.
