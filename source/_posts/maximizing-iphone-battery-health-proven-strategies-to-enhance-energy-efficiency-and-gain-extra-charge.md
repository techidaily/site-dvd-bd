## 5 Common iPhone Battery Problems & Solutions

### 1\. iPhone Battery Drains Fast

Are you familiar with the scenario: you're heading out for the day with your 100% charged iPhone, as you're on the bus, you check the news and you can see your battery percentage stays at 98%, then all of a sudden it drops to 75%? throughout the day, you find your iPhone battery drops in chunks for a couple of times, finally your iPhone shuts off before you go home. 

There could be various reasons for iPhone battery draining quickly than usual. The first thing you could do is to identity which app drains the battery mostly. If you can live without a battery-hungry app, just delete it. Though iOS takes care of suspending apps in the background, it's likely that some apps wake up in the background, which will also drop your battery. So you're also suggested to force close apps like VoIP, navigation and streaming audio/video apps if you're not using them since they are known to drain battery life. On the other hand, if you have to use the battery-hungry app, you should consider disabling location services, background app refresh, raise to wake, or using dark mode, low power mode to [improve your iPhone battery life](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). In short, if your iPhone battery drains fast even when not in use, try the following tips:

Delete the not commonly used yet battery-hungry apps. Go to Settings > Battery to find the apps which kill battery greatly. Back to the home screen to locate on the specific app, tap on it until a red X icon appears, click on the red X to delete it. 

Disable the Location Services. Go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services to turn off the location services. You can disable the location globally on your iPhone or just for apps that are overusing the feature.

Disable Background App Refresh. Go to Settings > General > Background App Refresh, and turn it off for apps like Facebook or other apps that don't need to be updated all the time.

Use Dark Mode in iPhone Apps. Go to Settings > Display & Brightness > Night Shift. From here you can set up a schedule to enable Night Shift at sunset, then turn it off again at sunrise. BTW, you can also reduce screen brightness under Display & Brightness

Use Low Power Mode. Go to Settings > Battery and tapping on the toggle. Apple says that iPhone in Low Power Mode mode can improve battery life by an additional 3 hours.

Other Tips: Place iPhone Facedown, turn off Raise to Wake, turn off dynamic wallpapers, update to the latest iOS version etc.

### 2\. iPhone Won't Charge 

You plug your iPhone in for charging, leave it for a few hours, and finally find that you've only gone up 15% or less. It's really annoying that your [iPhone won't charge](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). Sometimes you plug your iPhone in, you see the lightning bolt in the top right corner showing that your phone is charging. While you put it down, the lightning bolt disappears. To be frank, it might be a matter of charging port, USB cable or battery itself. So you can try the following steps to check the specific cause. 

Clean the charging port. Use a long, thin object like a toothpick to carefully scrape the insides of the charging port. Then you might work out a surprising amount of debris.

Check your USB cable. Make sure it's not damaged and it's an Apple charger instead of any ones you picked from one dollar store. 

Replace a new battery. If you still can't get charged, there might be something wrong with your battery. You can go Apple Store to get a battery replacement. 

### 3\. iPhone Gets Hot While Charging

Some users have reported an issue in which users feel their [iPhone are overheated while charging](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). And they are really afraid that it's gonna blow up. In 99% of cases, when your iPhone is hot because the CPU is revved up to 100% even when the screen is off. For example, playing games, using data usage apps like Facebook or Emails, fetching/pushing data can contribute to an increase in CPU usage. Besides, the bad connection and iPhone case also can also cause iPhone overheating while charging. To diagnose and fix an iPhone that gets hot, you can:

Try disabling the CPU-overused app. Go to Settings > General > Restrictions to disable apps of Multiplayer Games, Ping, App Store, iTunes Store etc. Then reboot.

Do a network connection reset. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Reset Network Setting, then reboot and reconnect your Wi-Fi connection. [How to Fix iPhone WiFi Not Working Problem >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)
