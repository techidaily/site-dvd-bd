**Scenario:** My friend wants to play American (Region 1) DVDs, but he lives in the UK (Region 2). Can region 2 DVD player from the UK play region 1 DVD? 

DVDs have [region codes](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). The numerical region codes on DVD is more like a copy protection to prevent DVDs from played on a DVD player from another region. A USA DVD is region 1 and formatted in NTSC. It cannot be played on a UK DVD player that is locked to region 2, unless you have a multi-region player. However, a region-free DVD player can be expensive. Here we share you some cheap and free methods to help you play USA Region 1 DVDs in UK. 

## Convert Region Code 1 DVD to Region-free File for Limitless Playback

**MacX DVD Ripper Pro** can bypass DVD region codes and convert region-locked DVDs to region-free files as MP4, MOV, ISO, MKV, and more formats. So if you want to play USA region code 1 DVD in UK, you can use this program to convert it to a region-free digital file. This way, you can play the DVD content anywhere you like.

Sony BDP-S6700: This is a popular choice that offers excellent image quality and supports 4K upscaling. It also has built-in Wi-Fi, allowing you to stream content from popular services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.

LG BP175: This is an affordable option that can play DVDs from any region and also supports upscaling to 1080p. It's a simple and reliable player that should meet the needs of most users. 

Panasonic DVD-S700EP-K: This is a high-end option that offers excellent image and sound quality. It supports upscaling to 1080p and has a USB port for playing digital media files.

### 2\. Hack to make your DVD player region-free 

Region-locked DVD player can be hacked to make it region-free. As long as you have a special unlock code for your player, you can type it into the DVD remote in such a way the region byte won't be checked by the player. This is a quick way to make your USA DVD playable in the UK or other areas. You can visit VideoHelp's DVD Player and Blu-ray Player region codes to see if your region-locked DVD player is hacked to be region-free. Then you can follow the steps to [unlock DVD region code](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) here. 

![Play USA DVD on UK computers](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-play-on-mac.jpg) 

**Note:** Remember not all players are going to have hacks. And the hacks are not guaranteed to work. They may even be a danger to your machine. 

### 3\. Download DVD Video Player Software 

There are still some cost-free ways to play USA DVD in UK without the need to buy physical player, among which VLC is highly recommended. It ignores the region codes and makes DVD playback a snap. Just download the desktop app, get it installed and launched, open the USA DVD, click on Media > Open Disc to watch your DVDs. Certainly, you need to prepare a computer with a solid DVD drive (latest DVD drive upgrade guaranteed, as well). 

![Use VLC to play USA region code 1 DVD in UK](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/vlc-start-rip.jpg) 

**Note:** Make sure change your computer DVD drive's region coding from 2 to 1\. Only by doing this can you play region 1 USA DVD on your computer in the United Kingdom. It's worth mentioning you can only change DVD region code of your disc drive for at most **5 times** and this workaround only works on computer, not your HDTV or smart TV.

### 4\. How to Reset DVD Drive's Region Code 

**1\. on PC computer** 

1. Press the Windows key + R to open the Run box. Type in devmgmt.msc and press OK.
2. Expand DVD/CD-ROM drives in the Device Manager > select Properties.
3. Click on the DVD Region tab > set the region in American > click OK.

**2\. on Mac computer**

Generally, a dialog will prompt asking you to change the region code for the drive. Just change the region code to 1 when your USA DVD doesn't match the region code of your UK DVD drive.

If you have some DVDs from the areas other than the USA, check the exact region code respectively in corresponding to the DVD regional distribution: 

![DVD region code](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/dvd-region-code.png) 

* Region code 1 - the United States, Canada and Bermuda
* Region code 2 - UK and Europe, Egypt, West Asia, Japan, South Africa, Greenland, French Guiana
* Region code 3 - Southeast Asia, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau
* Region code 4 - Latin America and Oceania
* Region code 5 - Africa, Russia, South Asia, Central Asia, North Korea and Mongolia
* Region code 6 - Mainland China

There are still region code 7 reserved for future use, MPAA-related DVDs and "media copies" of pre-releases in Asia and region code 8 for international venues such as aircraft, cruise ships and spacecraft.
