## What Makes MacX Video Converter Pro The Best HD Video Shrinker 

As is known to all, beyond the video formats, the video file size depends on many variables: HD vs. SD, frame rate, bitrate, color depth, and even the amount of movement in the video. Thankfully, the [free video compressor](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) \- MacX Video Converter Pro can adjust these parameters that count for a lot when you shrink and downsize video file size. 

**Convert Video Formats:** Video format matters a lot for video file size. And some formats like AVI, MKV, M2TS naturally take much more space than MP4, FLV, WebM, MOV etc. It is capable of converting and squeezing videos to smaller size formats. 

**Lower Resolution (HD to SD):** The video resolution is closely bound up with video size and quality. Higher resolution usually results in larger video file size. Changing the original video to a smaller resolution will lead to a smaller file size. To compress a HD MP4 video in 1920×1080P, you are suggested to lower it to 1280×720, 640×480, 640×360 for a smaller size.

**Decrease Bit rate:** As for the bit rate, lowering the bit rate will bring about the decrease of the video file size. But please keep in mind the image quality will be bad in case you make the bit rate too low. We suggest you lowering bit rate 20-30% of original file. For example, 720p video should have a bit rate between 5k-10k kbps while 1080p have a bit rate of 10k-20k kbps. 

**Reduce Frame rate:** With respect to frame rate, it has a lot to do with the file size. the lower frame rate, the smaller size you will get, and vice versa.
